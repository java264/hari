: - To write a MATLAB program to find power and energy of a given signal

Apparatus Required:-PC with MATLAB 7.0
PROGRAM:

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
int N,i,energy=0,power=0,x[30];
printf("Enter length of the sequence\n");
scanf("%d",&N);
printf("Enter inputs of the sequence\n");
for(i=0;i<N;i++)
{
scanf("%d",&x[i]);
energy=energy+x[i]*x[i];
}
power=energy/N;
printf("\n Energy of the given sequence =%d",energy);
printf("\n Power of the given sequence =%d",power);
}


Output
Enter length of the sequence=3
Enter inputs of the sequence= 1 2 3
Energy of the given sequence = 14
Power of the given sequence=4 
				


Result: calculated power and energy of a given sequence by using c-program
